- ✅ **Vibration Sequence:**
  - Long buzz (1s) → Start signal
  - Short buzzes per digit (1 buzz = 1, 2 buzzes = 2, etc.)
  - 10 buzzes = digit 0
  - Long pauses between digits (1.6s)
  - Long buzz (1s) → End signal
- ✅ **Example:** IP ending in .165 = Long buzz → 1 buzz → pause → 6 buzzes → pause → 5 buzzes → Long buzz

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Assembly:** Wire components according to pin configuration
2. **Upload Code:** Use PlatformIO to compile and upload
3. **WiFi Setup:** Device automatically creates "MeditationTimer-Setup" hotspot on first boot
4. **Configure Network:** 
   - Connect to the hotspot from any device
   - Navigate to `http://192.168.4.1/wifi-setup`
   - Select your WiFi network and enter password
   - Device will restart and connect to your network
5. **IP Address:** Device vibrates the last part of its IP address after connection
6. **Web Access:** Use the vibrated IP to access web interface (e.g., `http://10.10.10.165`)
7. **Training Mode:** Enable Wim Hof Training in the web dashboard for learning the device

### **Getting Started with Training Mode**

For first-time users, Training Mode provides an excellent way to understand the meditation flow:

1. **Connect to Web Interface:** Open the device's IP address in your browser
2. **Enable Wim Hof Training:** Click the "Enable Wim Hof Training" button on the dashboard
3. **Watch Real-time Updates:** See detailed explanations for each phase as you progress
4. **Learn the Process:** Understand what each vibration pattern means and what to expect
5. **Disable When Ready:** Turn off Training Mode for distraction-free meditation sessions

Training Mode provides educational content explaining the science and technique behind each phase, making it perfect for learning the Wim Hof breathing method. Note: training guidance currently covers the Wim Hof flow.

### **Understanding IP Address Vibration**

After WiFi setup, the device communicates its IP address through vibration patterns so you can access the web interface without needing a display:

#### **Vibration Pattern Guide:**
- **Long buzz (1 second):** Start of IP notification
- **Short buzzes (300ms each):** Each digit (count the buzzes)
  - 1 buzz = digit 1
  - 2 buzzes = digit 2
  - ...
  - 10 buzzes = digit 0 (to distinguish from no buzz)
- **Long pause (1.6 seconds):** Between each digit
- **Long buzz (1 second):** End of IP notification
- **3-second pause:** Separation before round count
- **Session rounds:** Current device round setting

#### **Example:** 
For IP address `10.10.10.165`, you'll hear:
```
Long buzz → 1 buzz → pause → 6 buzzes → pause → 5 buzzes → Long buzz
    ↓ (3 second pause) ↓
Current round count (e.g., 3 buzzes for 3 rounds)
```

**Tip:** Have a pen ready to write down the digits as the device vibrates them!
